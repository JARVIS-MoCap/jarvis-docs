This Manual covers all the basic steps you need to take to get from the idea of using markerless tracking to 3D pose predictions ready for analysis. This obviously makes it quite a lengthy read, so feel free to skip any sections that might not be relevant to you. The blue Troubleshooting boxes can be expanded by clicking on them and will contain some hopefully helpful hints if you encounter any issues.
